This week we're doing a little experiment in juicing. What is Juicing? Well, we could call it "game feel" but I prefer this definition: 

>*“'Juice' was our wet little term for constant and bountiful user feedback. A juicy game element will bounce and wiggle and squirt and make a little noise when you touch it. A juicy game feels alive and responds to everything you do — tons of cascading action and response for minimal user input. It makes the player feel powerful and in control of the world, and it coaches them through the rules of the game by constantly letting them know on a per-interaction basis how they are doing." - [emshort](https://emshort.blog/2008/05/24/make-it-juicy/)*

But what does that mean? Well, before we talk about juicing, i'd like show you. Head out and play a game for a while: 

> [They Started It](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=4088) You can read a little more about this game: here.

Now, that game is extremely overloaded. It is the poster child for juicing.

I mentioned the term "Game Feel" which is from author Steve Swink. He defines "Game Feel" as this sort of, "feeling" that comes from interacting with a video game. It's difficult to describe though you all know what I mean. To be a little more tangible and referential, I like this little bit from this [GamaSutra Blog](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130734/game_feel_the_secret_ingredient.php):

> *"The tactile sensation of manipulating a digital agent. The thing that makes your mom lean in her chair as she plays Rad Racer. Proxied embodiment. Game feel."*

Swink wrote a book about this and it's a book everyone will read at some point as they learn how to make games. It is called [_Game Feel: A Game Designer's Guide to Virtual Sensation_](http://www.game-feel.com/). 

There is a great review of the book here: [Liz England's Blog](http://www.lizengland.com/blog/2015/08/review-game-feel-by-steve-swink/) and if you haven't read much of Liz's blog, I highly recommend it. She used to run a game design book club and so she has gone through a huge number of books on games. Her reviews are always oriented for practical application so, "is it useful?" over "is it interesting?" is a good guide here.

#### So what does that mean for PICO-8? 

Well, there's other ways to define game feel or juicing but each of these definitions must be shown. Check out these 2 videos: 

* [Secrets of Game Feel and Juice | Game Maker's Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=216_5nu4aVQ)
* [Juice it or lose it - a talk by Martin Jonasson & Petri Purho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg)

The second one will have a lot of tangible examples for you as it gets in to the wonders of making _Breakout_ interesting.

And that's it. Here's a concept called Juicing. How would you juice up your game? That is what we're doing this week! 

Your job this week is to Juice your game. It doesn't matter how. It doesn't matter why. But your game is going to get a little more juicy.

There's a video here about juicing for PICO-8 that is pretty fantastic. You can find the video:
