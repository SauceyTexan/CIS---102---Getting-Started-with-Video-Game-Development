This week we're doing a little experiment in juicing. What is Juicing? Well, we could call it "game feel" but I prefer this definition: 

>*“'Juice' was our wet little term for constant and bountiful user feedback. A juicy game element will bounce and wiggle and squirt and make a little noise when you touch it. A juicy game feels alive and responds to everything you do — tons of cascading action and response for minimal user input. It makes the player feel powerful and in control of the world, and it coaches them through the rules of the game by constantly letting them know on a per-interaction basis how they are doing." - [emshort](https://emshort.blog/2008/05/24/make-it-juicy/)*

But what does that mean? Well, before we talk about juicing, i'd like show you. Head out and play a game for a while: 

> [They Started It](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=4088) You can read a little more about this game: here.

Now, that game is extremely overloaded. It is the poster child for juicing.

I mentioned the term "Game Feel" which is from author Steve Swink. He defines "Game Feel" as this sort of, "feeling." It's difficult to describe though you all know what I mean. I like this little bit from this [GamaSutra Blog]():

> *"The tactile sensation of manipulating a digital agent. The thing that makes your mom lean in her chair as she plays Rad Racer. Proxied embodiment. Game feel."*

Great review of the book here: [Liz England's Blog](http://www.lizengland.com/blog/2015/08/review-game-feel-by-steve-swink/)

So what does that mean for PICO-8? Well, there's other ways to define game feel or juicing but each of these definitions must be shown. Check out these 3 videos:

* [Juice it or lose it - a talk by Martin Jonasson & Petri Purho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg)

The second one will have a lot of tangible examples for you. 

And that's it. Here's a concept called Juicing. How would you

Your job this week is to Juice your game. It doesn't matter how. It doesn't matter why. But your game is going to get a little more juicy.

There's a video here about juicing though it's a little difficult to deal with. You can find the video:
