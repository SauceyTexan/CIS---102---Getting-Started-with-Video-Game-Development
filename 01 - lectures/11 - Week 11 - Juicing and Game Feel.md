This week we're doing a little experiment in juicing. Before we talk about juicing, i'd like you to head out and play a game for a while: 

- They Started It You can read a little more about this game: here.

Now, that game is extremely overloaded. It is the poster child for juicing. But what does this mean? 

“Juice” was our wet little term for constant and bountiful user feedback. A juicy game element will bounce and wiggle and squirt and make a little noise when you touch it. A juicy game feels alive and responds to everything you do — tons of cascading action and response for minimal user input. It makes the player feel powerful and in control of the world, and it coaches them through the rules of the game by constantly letting them know on a per-interaction basis how they are doing.

Another way to consider what juicing is can be found below.

Your job this week is to Juice your game. It doesn't matter how. It doesn't matter why. But your game is going to get a little more juicy.
