**By the end of this week you should be able to:**
1. Discover ways to transition between levels.
1. Generate levels through a function.
1. Understand how to deal with multiple levels. 

**Optionally, you could also learn to:**
* Figure out how to use the level editor in the graphic portion of Pico-8.
* Understand how to draw multiple levels in that level editor.

This week is all about levels or that essential component of a game that lets your players know they're getting somewhere. There are a *lot* of ways to deal with levels. You could:
1. Make a gigantic map and manually add things to it.
1. Make a gigantic map but split it up into tiny maps or rooms.
1. Generate a random map for players each game.
1. Generate a random sequence of objects for games that don't require rooms.
1. Keep going forever with just 1 level.

Of all of these ways to consider levels, we're going to concern ourselves with just 1 for right now: *generating sequences for games that don't require rooms.*

Over the semester, we've been dealing a lot with Breakout and Pong. We'll be getting a little deeper into that game and do what couldn't be done when these games were new: change stuff. 

What you'll do this week is start with a piece of code and then go through a couple tutorials and edit it / change it how you see fit. 

Why you're doing this this way is that editing code is a great way to see and explore how things are done. Applying that stuff is step 2 but that's something that will come with time. 

## Getting Started

### What you'll be doing.
Start with the source code from [this pastebin](https://pastebin.com/kfPreVSy). Explore this code, get to know what it does. Add some comments about what you think each section does. 

To get in to the techniques and patterns for this content, you will be watching 2 video tutorials:
1. [Generating Level Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc7cE-NZh0I&index=18&list=PLYND9uft5u_1YCkmXiMrPU7tiBG3hIKAZ)
1. [Levels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6sFwambeUQ&index=19&list=PLYND9uft5u_1YCkmXiMrPU7tiBG3hIKAZ)

I will also be providing a breakdown of what each portion of this code does in my announcement for week 8. 

### Optional material

We haven't touched on the map editor. This editor allows us to create rooms and areas that players can explore. While it might not be something that you're required to know, it's good to get some exposure to the possibilities it contains.  To get started, check out these readings: 

* [Luke Merrett's PICO-8 Intro](https://lukemerrett.com/getting-started-with-pico-8/)
* [Uncle Matt's Background and Map Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWoeBr_FQ3Y&index=3&list=PL_T5GuTZSAoC63B8nVmstVNJA5odk-ViH) - This whole tutorial is fantastic.

By the end of this week, my hope is that you have a lot more familiarity with how the map editor works in PICO-8. It is a fantastic tool that can really help to expand your game.
