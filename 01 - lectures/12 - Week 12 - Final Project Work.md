For the past 11 weeks, you have been gaining a foundation for creating games in the PICO-8 environment. There is no new content this week so this file and the assignment will look exactly the same. 

This is the last week of class! As it is the last week, you turn in your final project that you outlined in week 7. What you'll turn in this week is:

## Part 1 - Your Game 
1. Submit your .p8 file.  (50 points)
1. Upload it to the PICO-8 website. (50 points)

## Part 2 - Your Narrative 
1. This is a post-mortem for your game in the same vein as your midterm project. (50 points)
	1. 500-700 words and it should have the following sections.
		* What did you do?
		* Why did you do it the way you did?
		* What did you have trouble with?
		* Are you happy with the result?
		* What do you wish you knew going in to this project?

## Rubrics and Expectations
This is the final project. In addition to the games being playable, they should also:
1. Contain Sounds and Sound Effects. Background music is not required but if you put it in, that's awesome.
1. Contain a little bit of juice. Specifically, i'm looking for 3 ways you juiced your project. 
1. Be significantly different from your midterm. This includes tightened up code, fewer bugs, and more choices for players to make.
