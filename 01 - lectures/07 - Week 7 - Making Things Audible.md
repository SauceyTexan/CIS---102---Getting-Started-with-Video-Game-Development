This week is the week after you midterm and so I thought it would be nice to do something a little light. 

In the Lightbike Exercise, you learned about how to assign sounds to a particular event. You already know how to do this. 

What you are meant to do is add or alter the audio from your midterm project. Submit that adjusted midterm as well as a narrative file about your exploration of the sound editor in the normal way.

Additionally, these tutorials are also amazing.
