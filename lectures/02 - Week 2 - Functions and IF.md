**By the end of this week you should be able to:**
1. Name, Save, and Load your PICO-8 files.
1. Write comments in the coding environment.
1. Create and Describe variables 
1. Create rectangles and circles of different colors.
1. Understand the 3 functions of PICO-8's Game Loop.
1. Use IF statements to make objects react to the edges of the screen.

**Optionally, you could also learn to:**
1. Install Notepad++ and use it in conjunction with PICO-8.
1. Install Sublime Text to use in conjunction with PICO-8

# Week 2 - IF, Functions and Variables!
There are 3 central concepts this week that will form the basis of the rest of the class: 
1. Create objects.
1. Do stuff with those objects.
1. Do stuff to those objects.

Sounds goofy, right? But think about it for a second. If we're getting started with a game of breakout, then we need to: 

A. Create a ball and paddle.
A. Do stuff with that ball and paddle.
A. Do something to the ball and paddle.



## Getting Over the AAA Experience
As a gamer, I have been inside the world of video games since the Magnavox Odyssey was new. I've been inside of the creation of video games since around the late 1990s when I started making Quake levels and dealing with the remnants of shareware games. For many of you who are undergrads now, that space was around before you were even born and so when I say video game, you might conjure up Playstation 3 or XBox 360 as "old." My job as the insructor for this course is to deal with two sepcific things: 

1. Get you to turn that thing you consume into that thing you are capable of producing.
1. Dispell the expectation that you can re-create the games you've been playing since you were young.

It's the second item that makes my job hard. We all want to re-create games we've played before. I can't even tell you how often I hear folks say, "I just want to remake Call of Duty: Modern Warfare." Or, "I loved Grand Theft Auto IV and want to make a new one." These things aren't possible. To make those games, you had tens of thousands of hours distributed among hundreds of workers across the fields that comprise or engage computation, marketing, social science, graphic design, and game design. 

You're just you and you don't have a few hundred million dollars to spend. So, what I can offer is to get you started on the path so you can join those teams. If I get you on that path, i'm super excited. 

To answer number one, i've decided to give the fantasy console the chance it needs - as a space where you can move your consumptive behaviors to production. This is a horribly difficult task for anyone. I was once told that education is the disenchant of the wonder of our childhood. I think this is unfair as for a lot of us, learning how to build the stuff we loved as kids is amazing. What's more adult than making something for others to experience? 

I'm excited because the Fantasy Consoles were created to capture that spirit of creation and discovery that was present before there was a video game industry. 

If you're interested, these books really get in to that space of creation:

A lot of what we'll go over here today is also captured on [this wiki page](http://pico-8.wikia.com/wiki/Lua). If you'd like to try and jump ahead you can, but just know that you'll be expected to meet the requirements of your homework each week. This means you'll have to point out things in your code via comments and line numbers.
