## Rubrics and Expectations
This is the final project. In addition to the games being playable, they should also:
1. Contain Sounds and Sound Effects. Background music is not required but if you put it in, that's awesome.
1. Contain a little bit of juice. Specifically, i'm looking for 3 ways you juiced your project. 
1. Be significantly different from your midterm. This includes tightened up code, fewer bugs, and more choices for players to make.
