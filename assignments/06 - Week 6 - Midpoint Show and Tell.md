# The Midterm Project
## Or...show us what you've learned

So you've spent the last few weeks learning about 5 distinct topics: 
1. Intro and Basics
1. Functions 
1. Player Input
1. Collisions
1. Game States

At this point, you now know enough to have a working prototype for classic games like *Pong!*, *Breakout* or something along those lines. 

So this project right now is all about putting all that stuff together. Sure, you have already got this code all 
in place but is it *YOURS*? Let's see what you can do. 

This week, you are showing us what you can do. Here are the parameters of the midterm. You must include adjustments or new code that dictates:  
1. Movement. (30 points)
1. Collisions. (30 points)
1. Game States. (30 points)
1. 500-750 words about your project (10 points)

___

What the adjustments are is up to you but it must at least look and act differently than the example code at the end of week 5. If you want to add color, adjust width, adjust speed, add balls, add bricks, or other things, do it! Here is a breakdown of each parameter. 

Just remember that all you have is a week! 
___

### Movement (30 points)
For movement, players need to be able to push the standard buttons and have something occur. For what we've done so far, you have a rectangle that moves back anf forth across the screen. Now is your chance to adjust those things.

| Requirement                                     	| 10 points  	| 5 points                   	| 0 points        	|
|-------------------------------------------------	|------------	|----------------------------	|-----------------	|
| Player movement is more than just the demo code 	| Full Marks 	| No significant adjustments 	| Nothing Changed 	|
| Player movement is smooth                       	| Full Marks 	| No significant adjustments 	| Nothing Changed 	|
| Code for player movement is well-commented      	| Full Marks 	| No significant adjustments 	| Nothing Changed 	|

### Collisions (30 points)
For collision, objects should be running in to each other. In the case of the examples, we have a ball running in to paddles and bricks. Can something happen to those bricks upon being hit? 

[Breakout Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dElgcbsHdA) can give you a lot of hints!

### Game States (30 points)
For game states, this is a chance to name your game, create your signature style, and provide a little customization. We covered some of this in class but now this is on you. Your submission should include: 

1. A Title Screen.
1. A Normal Game State.
1. An End Game Screen.
	* The end game screen should allow you to reset the game or if you've instituted lives, the loss of a 1 life.

## Your Post-Mortem or Narrative (10 points)
1. 500-700 words.
	* What did you do?
	* Why did you do it the way you did?
	* What did you have trouble with?
	* Are you happy with the result?
	* What do you wish you knew going in to the midterm?

## Reminder: What to Submit!

After working for the week, you should have 2 files to submit: 
1. The .p8 file.
2. Your narrative file.

Place them in a compressed folder and submit via Blackboard.

In addition to this, please paste a link to your game from the [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?cat=7&sub=2) Carts page to the forums. (10 points)

Perform a review of at least 2 other games (10 points). These should take the form of the other reviews you've done. Remember from previous weeks this is done in the following way: 

>Click around in the discussion forum and check out the links of your fellow students. Look for a game that seems interesting. Play it for "a while." Once you've played it, click on the link above and enter the following: 

>**Name of the game and Link**

>**What made you play it?**
>(2 sentences that go beyond – “It looked neat.” or "Because I had to finish the assignment.")

>**What did you like about it OR what was useful about it?**
(2 sentences that go beyond – “It was fun.” Or “It was interested.”)

>**What didn’t you like about it?**
>(2 sentences that go beyond – “It was fun.” Or “It wasn’t fun.” OR “It wasn’t interesting.”)

>**In addition to your post: **
>(Post 1 response to 2 other threads in that week's discussion board.)
(These responses should be about a paragraph in length.)

>The word substantive gets thrown around a lot but what does that mean? Your responses should be enough to provoke conversation. We all have opinions about games and those opinions will influence the games we make. Writing “substantive” posts will not only help those you’re writing for but yourself as well.
