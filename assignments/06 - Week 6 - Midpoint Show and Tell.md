## Part 1 - What will you show us?

By now, you have been following along with the programming examples and should have a game that resembles Pong or Breakout depending on if you went with 1 or two player games. This assignment is a chance for you to do a little work on your own. Your assignment this week is to provide a game that shows the following: 

1. Movement.
1. Collisions.
1. Game States.

You will also enclose a narrative file about your work. These will be 500-750 words.

### Movement
For movement, players need to be able to push the standard buttons and have something occur. For what we've done so far, this is essentially moving a paddle back and forth but you're welcome to try more if you like. Just remember that all you have is a week! 

### Collisions
For collision, objects should be running in to each other. In the case of the examples, we have a ball running in to paddles and bricks. What will you do?

### Game States
For game states, this is a chance to name your game, create your signature style, and provide a little customization. This aspect of the work should include: 

1. A Title Screen.
1. A Normal Game State.
1. An End Game Screen.

From end game, you should be able to press a button and start again. 

## Part 2 - Submission

You should have 2 files to submit: 
1. The .p8 file.
2. Your narrative file.

Place them in a compressed folder and submit.
