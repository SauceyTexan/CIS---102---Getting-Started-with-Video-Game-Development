# Week 2 - IF, Functions and Variables!
There are three concepts that every programming environment needs to deal with: 
1. Defining Variables.
1. Doing Stuff with those variables.
1. Creating canned functions to do stuff with variables.

With these three things, you can build an endless array of procedures, arguments, and conditional statements that (when combined) create reactive and interactive environments that we call games, software, or tools. This week, we will be starting our process of creating a game.
