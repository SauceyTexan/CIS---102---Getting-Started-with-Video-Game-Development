## Assignment Instructions

For the next 12 weeks, you will be working with the fantasy console *PICO-8* and learning about video game production, creation, and design. This folder contains all of the assignments you will be asked to do. Each assignment builds on the last and each assignment increases in complexity. While the course will be challenging at times, all of these things are doable within a few hours each week. 

If you need help, please ask! 

### The 1-Hour Rule
We will be programming and working with technology. This is a strange space to work in that consists of trying to convince a computer to do certain things in a certain amount of time with certain goals in mind. 

*If at any time you have worked for more than an hour without actually solving a problem, get up and leave the computer for a while. Take a walk, take a nap, watch an episode of a tv show, watch a movie. Do something that gets you away from that space.*

Once you've given your brain a rest, give it another chance. If after another hour you still haven't solved or even figured out where to go next, email me or post on the blackboard forum for help!

Generally, each week's submission follows these guidelines:

## Submission
1. Create a .p8 file for this week's work.
1. Write a 500-750 narrative about this weeks' work. 
1. Add the files to a compressed folder and submit.
