This first homework assignment is about getting familiar with the various aspects of PICO-8. The goal then is for you to show me that you understand how to use PICO-8's interface in order to show, rather than tell what you are doing. 

1. Create a GIF of you loading a game from PICO-8 from the clipboard. 
1. Create a GIF of you pasting code from a PICO-8 game into the programming interface and running it.
  1. Note that this will require you to find a game that runs without using graphics. 
1. Create a GIF of you typing the code, "print('hello world')" and running it. 
1. Create a GIF of you navigating the SPLORE menu.
1. Take a screenshot of the PICO-8 folder that contains your .p8 files.
1. Place all of these photos in a compressed folder and submit it via Blackboard.
