# Welcome to your first day with PICO-8! 

You might be asking yourself, "What the hell is PICO-8?" 

Well, PICO-8 is what is called a "Fantasy Console" which doesn't really answer the question. What i'd offer is that one of the best descriptions I found for what a fantasy console is comes from [this article](https://medium.com/@G05P3L/fantasy-console-wars-a-guide-to-the-biggest-players-in-retrogamings-newest-trend-56bbe948474d).

```The PICO-8 seeks to emulate the aesthetics and community of 1980s home computing for a modern audience. Folks who grew up with these early home computers, such as the BBC Micro, Commodore 64 & ZX Spectrum, often programmed software for them via a built-in BASIC interpreter, creating games and apps that were shared through cassette tapes and floppy disks.```

The nice part about the fantasy console world is that they are: 
1. Easy to use.
1. Easy to learn.
1. Provide endless possibility.

During this course, you will be working on making your own game for people to play. While finishing the game depends on you, the class will help you along with grades and milestones.
