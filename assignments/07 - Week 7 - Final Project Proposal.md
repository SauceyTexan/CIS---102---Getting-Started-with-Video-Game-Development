## The Final Project Proposal (50 points)
At this point, you've got almost everything you need to construct a game on your own. All you're really missing is some rudimentary AI but we're coving that next week. 

At this point in the class, you will be sending in a proposal about a game project you'd like to make. Keep in mind that you can also keep building, juicing, and editing your midterm project for your final project. 

What the proposal needs is as follows: 

1. A 1-paragraph description of your game. 
>This could be a continuation of your midterm project or it could be something new. Your description needs to describe the objects you'll need to create, the way they'll interact, and how it will all look and feel. This paragraph will be scrutinized to see if you've really thought your idea through. 

2. A list of objects needed for your game. 
3. A list of procedures you'll need to write. 
>For example, what all do you need to consider for your game? Pong requires a Ball, that ball needs to bounce, the player needs to move a paddle. The paddle needs to detect and react to the ball. The second player's paddle needs to react to the ball. When the ball goes past a paddle something needs to happen. There needs to be a final state for the game. Oh, and an intro screen would be great as well!

4. What problems do you anticipate?
5. What tasks do you need to accomplish bringing your game to fruition?

All in all, this should be about a page or two. In a couple weeks, i'll be asking you for a progress report!
