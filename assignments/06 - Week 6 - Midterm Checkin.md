## The Midterm Checkin (30 points)
The midterm is due in 2 weeks. If you haven't started it yet, go click on that week to see what all you'll be needing to do. The midterm checkin serves as a way for me to make sure that you're doing ok. 

The midterm checkin is pretty straight forward. Each week, you've been asked to do some bit of code that allows you to do a little bit more with PICO-8. At this point, you should have a separate file called, `midterm.p8` that you've been messing with here and there. You're going to submit that with a paragraph that contains the following information: 

1. What have you been doing to explore the concepts we've been working on each week?
1. How is that experimentation going?
1. What's something you're enjoying with your game at the moment?
1. What is something you want to do but don't understand?

In addition to the paragraph, each of you is going to ask 3 questions that relates to your project. These questions can be anything ranging from LUA to PICO-8 to the Game Industry and any doubts you might have about that. Sarcastic questions or non-sensical questions won't really do me or you any good. So please try to ask about something you're curious about!
