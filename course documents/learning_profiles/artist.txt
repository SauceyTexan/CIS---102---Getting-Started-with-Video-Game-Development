1. Background
The artist has been drawing and creating art for a number of years. They are interested in video games and becoming a video game artist. 

2. What they already know.
The artist has a lot of experience with the various aspects creating art. Because this is a video game course, the likelihood that the artist is a video game fan is high. The artist might be a physical artist only but they could also be those who create 3D models or use other forms of electronic tools like Paint-Tool Sai, the Creative Cloud, or other art-related software.

3. What they think they need to do.
The artist wants to get more involved with making video games but is not well-versed in programming. They need to begin to learn to make games and this is something of an abstract concept. 

4. How the course will help them.
This course will set them on a course to make the act of creating games less abstract. If they do not continue programming, they will at least understand how programming relates to movement on the screen.

5. Needs
The artist will need special care when creating instruction for each week as many of the concepts will force the artist to think in ways that are very unknown to them.
